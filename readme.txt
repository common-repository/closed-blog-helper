== Description ==

Instead of a shortcode `[closed-blog-helper]` shows a (customizable) message for the visitor according to their access rights to the blog.

Intended for use on multisite, but should work on single blogs too.

It recognizes five different situations:

* Superadmin
* Admin
* Logged in but not registered on the blog (cannot `read`)
* Logged in and can `read`
* Visitor

Message texts can be customized using few predefined keywords.

Developed for private use, but has perspective for more extensive usage. I can't guarantee any support in the future nor further development, but it is to be expected. Kindly inform me about bugs, if you find any, or propose new features: zaantar@zaantar.eu.

== Installation ==
